(1).Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet.

A protocol is a set of rules that computers follow to communicate with each other on the Internet 
It helps in sending and receiving data in a proper and organized way. For example  HTTP and FTP.

(2). What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine ?

A web browser is a software application used to open and view websites, while a search engine is a
tool that helps users find information or websites on the Internet.

(3). Define the World Wide Web (WWW).

The World Wide Web is a system of interlinked web pages that can be accessed through the Internet 
using a web browser.

(4). Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.

A static web page shows the same content to all users and does not change automatically,
whereas a dynamic web page can change its content based on user interaction or data from a database.

(5). Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.

The client-server architecture is a model where the client and server have different roles. 
The client is usually the user’s web browser, which sends requests for web pages. 
The server is a computer that stores websites and responds to client requests by 
sending the required data.When a user types a website address in the browser, the 
browser acts as a client and sends a request to the web server. This request is usually
made using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. After receiving the request, the server 
processes it and sends the required information, such as a web page, images, or 
data, back to the client. The browser then displays this information to the user.

Diagram:
Client (Browser) → Request → Web Server
Client (Browser) ← Response ← Web Server
This system allows many users to access the same server at the same time.

(6). Describe the functions of Email, FTP, and VoIP.

Email is used to send and receive messages electronically over the Internet.It helps in 
official and personal communication, such as sending motices and applications etc. 

FTP is used for transferring files from one computer to another, especially for uploading and 
downloading files. It is commonly used by the developers and programmers to manage website
files on a server .

VoIP allows people to make voice or video calls using the Internet instead of traditional
telephone lines. It also reduces the communication cost and is widely used in apps which were 
used by many peoples in the pandemic like Zoom and Whatsapp etc.

(7). “The Internet is a network of networks.” Explain this statement with packet switching.

The Internet is called a network of networks because it connects many smaller networks 
around the world. Data is sent using packet switching, where information is divided 
into small packets.When data is sent over the Internet, packet switching is used. 
In packet switching, the data is divided into small parts called packets. 
Each packet carries a portion of the data along with the destination address. These packets 
may travel through different paths depending on network traffic.


(8). A startup company wants a website with same information for all users and low maintenance.
Would you agree to use a dynamic website?

No, I would not agree to use a dynamic website. Since the information is the same for all users
and maintenance cost needs to be low, a static website is more suitable. Static websites are
simple, cost-effective, and easier to maintain compared to dynamic websites.

I would not agree touse a dynamic website because using a dynamic website would increase the 
choice in the programming language as in the dyanamic website there is use of language like PHP,
python and java scrypt and in static websites there is use of HTML and CSS which would likely
lower the cost of maintainance. In a static websites there would be proper use of database which
need a proper person for handling database only and for a startup it would likely hamper in the 
budget of the certain company.

(9). A website opens using IP address but not using domain name. Diagnose the problem.

Every website on the internet identified by an IP address, which is numerical address used 
by computers to locate servers. IP address are hard to remember as it is in numerical form.
When a person enters the domain name in the browser, it is converted into an IP address with 
the help of DNS .

If a website opens correctly when the IP address is used but does not open when the domain name
is entered, it shows that the web server and internet connection are working properly. The main
problem in this situation is related to the DNS system. The DNS server is unable to translate 
the domain name into the correct IP address.

This problem may occur due to incorrect DNS configuration, DNS server failure, or issues with 
domain registration. Since the website can still be accessed using the IP address, it can be 
concluded that the issue is not with the server but with the DNS service.

(10). A company wants to share sensitive data with suppliers only. 
Which network type should be used and why?
The company should use an Extranet. An extranet allows controlled access to specific external 
users such as suppliers while keeping the data secure. It is more secure than the Internet and
more flexible than an intranet. 

In intranet the data can only be accessed by the employees and in internet the data can be accessed 
by any one over the network so extranet would be likely the only option remaining as in extranet
we can share the data with selective persons. Extranet is also highly secured which would allows 
the company to share the sensative data with suppliers only in secured way. Extranet also uses 
strong authentication like username password , VPN , encryption etc. 

As extranet would be an option with secure collaboration and data exchabge with suppliera and 
it is also the one of the options which would be less risky because of the limited access and 
monitored.
